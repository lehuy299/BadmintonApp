* __We will create the function when the Player booked successfully.We will give them the Booking Code to query the information of the player in the table booking and to confirm that whether is it a real customer or not.__
* __We will use string of Booking Code, Player ID and TimeStamp to decrypt,then compare to the booking table that it is the same or not.__
* __If the Booking Code is so long,then we can convert this into QR Code.__
